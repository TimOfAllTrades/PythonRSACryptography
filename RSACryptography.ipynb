        "# RSA Cryptography explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "RSA cryptography remains a mathematically secure method of performing asymmetric cryptography.  In this notebook, we will provide an example and explain the mathematical fundamentals of the encryption decryption process.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background\n",
        "\n",
        "Data sent through the internet will be go through various nodes, i.e. (switches, routers and hubs) before reaching the final destination.  It must be assumed that at every node, there exists an opportunity for an eavesdropper to monitor and log all data that goes through.  Thus, data encryption is necessary to prevent the interception of sensitive data in this manner.  A sender and receiver both possess a key that will encrypt data when sent through the internet and decrypt data after it has reached its destination.  Any data intercepted in between will be meaningless to people without the encryption/decryption keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "This introduces another logistical issue in that sending an encryption key sent through the internet (to initiate the exchange of encrypted data) will also be intercepted by eavesdroppers thus defeating the purpose of any further encryption.  To counter this, is necessary for the encryption key to be different than the decryption key.  For example, if Bob wants to initiate a secure communication channel through the internet, Bob would broadcast an encryption key that everyone can use to encrypt data to send to him, but only Bob will have the decryption key to decrypt the encrypted data sent to him.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Mathematical concept\n",
        "\n",
        "RSA operates on the mathematical principle so that with 3 numbers *a*, *b*, and *c*, an encryption and decryption cycle can be completed as below:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ plaintext^{\\small a} \\enspace mod \\enspace c = ciphertext $$\n",
        "\n",
        "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">and</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ ciphertext^{\\small b} \\enspace mod \\enspace c = plaintext $$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A very simple example can be demonstrated with *a* = 13, *b* = 37, *c* = 77, and *plaintext* = 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since 2 is the number we want to keep secret and encrypt, we will take *plaintext* (2) to the *a* power first and the encrypted number (ciphertext) will be the remainder when divided by *c*.\n",

        "\n",
        "The ciphertext is 15 since that is the remainder when 4096 is divided by 77.\n",
        "\n",
        "To revert the number 15 back to the plain text, then the we take it to the *b*th power and do a modulo division with *c*\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "from which the above equation results in 2, same as the original plaintext.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since *a* *b* and *c* are necessary to complete an encryption and decryption cycle, publicly broadcasting *a* and *c* would only provide the public the ability to encrypt data, whereas the person who secretly keeps *b* private, would only be able to decrypt data that was encrypted by a and c.\n",
        "\n",
        "The above example only demonstrates a simple case.  In practicality, *a* *b* and *c* are hundreds or even thousands of digits long.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Thus *a* and *c* are the public keys, the numbers necessary to encrypt data and *b* is the private key, the number required to decrypt data.**\n",
        "\n",
        "While the public and private keys are mathematically linked, determining b from a and c requires knowing the factors of c.  If c were a product of two very large prime numbers, then determining b would be extremely difficult as there exists no efficient way to factor a product of large prime numbers.  A person can create its own public and private key set by generating two large prime numbers and its safety its guaranteed so long as nobody can factor it.\n",
